/**
 * A producer of items (and related control messages) received by {@link Subscriber}s.
 * <p>
 * Each current {@link Subscriber} receives the same items (via method onNext) in the same order, unless drops or errors
 * are encountered.  If a {@link Publisher} encounters an error that does not allow items to be issued to a
 * {@link Subscriber}, that {@link Subscriber} receives {@link Subscriber#onError(Throwable)}, and then receives no
 * further messages. Otherwise, when it is known that no further messages will be issued to it, a {@link Subscriber}
 * receives {@link Subscriber#onComplete()}.
 * <p>
 * {@link Publisher}s ensure that {@link Subscriber} method invocations for each subscription are strictly ordered in
 * happens-before order.  {@link Publisher}s may vary in policy about whether drops (failures to issue an item because
 * of resource limitations) are treated as unrecoverable errors.  {@link Publisher}s may also vary about whether
 * {@link Subscriber}s receive items that were produced or available before they subscribed.
 * <p>
 * {@link Subscriber}s may cancel receiving items at any time by calling {@link Subscription#cancel()}.
 * <p>
 * {@link Subscriber}s are expected to process published items immediately, without causing unnecessary delay to the
 * {@link Publisher} publishing said items.
