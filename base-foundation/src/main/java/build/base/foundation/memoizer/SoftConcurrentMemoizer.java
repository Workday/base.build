/**
 * A thread-safe {@link Memoizer} that holds memoized results with {@link SoftReference}s,
 * allowing the JVM to reclaim them under memory pressure. Evicted entries are transparently
 * recomputed on the next {@link #compute(Object)} call.
 * <p>
 * The fast-path read ({@link #readCache}) does not evict stale references to avoid a race between
 * concurrent reads and writes. Stale wrappers are overwritten when the value is recomputed under
 * the per-key lock.
 * <p>
 * {@link #size()} is approximate: it counts all entries including those whose referents have
 * already been collected.
 * <p>
 * For a non-concurrent variant see {@link SoftMemoizer}.
