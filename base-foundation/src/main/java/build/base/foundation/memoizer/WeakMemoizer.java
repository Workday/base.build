/**
 * A non-thread-safe {@link Memoizer} that holds keys with weak references, allowing the JVM to
 * evict entries once a key is no longer strongly reachable. The entry for a key is recomputed
 * transparently on the next {@link #compute(Object)} call after eviction.
 * <p>
 * Use this when the memoizer's lifetime should follow the key's lifetime rather than memory
 * pressure. For eviction driven by memory pressure see {@link SoftMemoizer}.
 * <p>
 * For concurrent use see {@link WeakConcurrentMemoizer}.
