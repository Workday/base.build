 * vertex pair, {@code MultiEdge} uses default {@link Object} identity — two {@code MultiEdge}
 * instances are equal only if they are the same object.  This allows multiple parallel edges
 * between the same pair of vertices to coexist and remain independently referenceable.
 * <p>
 * Instances are created exclusively by {@link Multigraph.Builder#addEdge(Object, Object)},
 * which returns the created edge so callers can retain a reference to each specific edge.
