/**
 * The common vertex-structure interface for all graph types in this library.
 * <p>
 * Exposes the vertex set, adjacency (successors and predecessors), and the
 * {@link GraphCollections} factory used for both graph storage and algorithm scratch
 * allocations.  All graph algorithms in the domain classes ({@link GraphTraversal},
 * {@link GraphOrdering}, {@link GraphCycles}, {@link GraphConnectivity},
 * {@link GraphReduction}) operate against this interface, making them applicable to
 * any conforming implementation.
 * <p>
 * Current implementations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Graph} — simple directed or undirected graph</li>
 *   <li>{@link WeightedGraph} — directed or undirected graph with typed edge weights</li>
 * </ul>
 * Future implementations (e.g. multigraph) will also implement this interface, at which
 * point the existing algorithms will automatically apply to them without modification.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not expose edge objects directly, as the edge type varies across
 * implementations ({@link Edge}, {@link WeightedEdge}, and future multi-edge types).
 * Edge-type-specific operations are found on the concrete classes.
 *
