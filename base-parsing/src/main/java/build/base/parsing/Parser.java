/**
 * A full-grammar parser — Layer A of base-parsing's two parser styles.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Parser<T>} consumes its entire input and produces a {@code T}, or throws a domain-specific
 * exception.  Used by full grammars such as ELParser, JtParser, ModuleInfoParser, AbcParser, and JsonParser.
 * The standard implementation extends {@link AbstractParser}, which provides {@link Scanner} construction,
 * full-input-consumption assertion, exception translation, and grammar helpers.
 * <p>
 * For composable fragments (combinator-style, soft no-match via {@link java.util.Optional#empty()}), see
 * {@link Rule} (Layer B).
 *
 * @param <T> the type of value produced
