/**
 * Asynchronously pipes a stream of characters read from a {@link Reader}, one line at a time, to a {@link Writer}
 * using a <i>Virtual Thread</i>, until either:

 *     <li>the end of the stream of input characters is reached,</li>
 *     <li>either {@link Reader} or {@link Writer} is closed, or</li>
 *     <li>termination is requested.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link java.io.PipedReader}s and {@link java.io.PipedWriter}s, {@link Pipe}s additionally allow:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>transformation of lines read from a {@link Reader} prior to writing them to a {@link Writer}, and</li>
 *     <li>publishing of the <i>un-transformed</i> lines to {@link Subscriber}s</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * {@link Pipe}s are intended to be used once and only once for a given {@link Reader}.  Once {@link #open()}ed, a
 * {@link Pipe} may not be opened again.  Attempting to reconfigure or subscribe to an opened {@link Pipe} will be
 * ignored.
